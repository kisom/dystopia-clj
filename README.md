# dystopia

A [noir](http://www.webnoir.org)-based front end to an eBook library.

## Usage

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```

### Getting Leiningen
dystopia uses the [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 
automation suite to handle getting dependencies and setting up the Java 
environment. You should take a look through the project's 
[README]
but the quick way is to do the following:

0. download the [lein](https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein)
script
0. make the lein script executable and place it on your path
0. cd /path/to/dystopia
0. lein deps, run
0. dystopia should now be running on the localhost on port 8080
